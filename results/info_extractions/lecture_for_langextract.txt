# LECTURE ANALYSIS: Types of Attributes
## Video Segment: 79:59 - 83:50

[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]
What is Data?
Collection of data objects and their attributes
An attribute is a property or characteristic of an object.
A collection of attributes also describes an object.
Object is also known as record, point, case, sample, entity, or tuple.

long as it is within the deadline. I haven't received the NTU COOL account registration email. Is there anything I need to do? Lottery will be rolled in the end of today's course. The grade of the quiz does not matter, but participation does.

[TRANSCRIPT - 80:01]
Okay, so what is data? When you mentioned about data, you need to know most of data comes from database. Currently, database still utilize relational database. When we talk relational database is because they were having table. We call them relation. In the table, we have attribute. Each column of them are attribute. Okay? Each row, each row, we call them transaction or record. Depends on how you try to do that. Transaction is more for database turns saying that how many record tuple you can relate to it. You have your tuple or you can talking about point. So every row right here is related to record.

Types of Attributes
There are different types of attributes

[TRANSCRIPT - 80:54]
Okay. And then right here, we want to talking about type of attribute. Because later on, then you want I will assign you some after class exercise. After class exercise, you need to working with it. But then, first, we try to tell you that the attribute we can somehow partition them to different type. By the way, the type right here is not data type. If you learn data structure, you will have data type, but it is not data type. We are talking about different. So we have four different type: Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio. How we partition those attribute depends on the operation they are allowed to do. And then their data type right here, I have something okay, which means Nominal is a one you can do last operation. Ratio is the one you can do all operation that including Nominal, Ordinal, Interval. So it depends on how many operation you can work with. So then you can see that one is from minus to plus. So for each one of them, Nominal data, you can only do comparison, equal or not equal. We call them categorical operation. That only working on categorical data. Ordinal data is called ordinal because it related to order. So we call them ordinal. Ordinal data, you can not only equal or not equal, you can also compare the order. Interval data, they will have some interval. This meaning is important. So then they can have equal space. That is called interval data. Ratio data, you can do equal and then you can also do proportion. You can see there's very tiny word called true zero. Ratio data, you do have something called zero. That zero mean zero, nothing. Okay? You need to know true zero is mean not just because they have a value called zero. That zero also mean nothing.
